## 🏗️ Architecture

Based on Poolside's Model Factory blog series, implementing:

- **🔧 Data Pipeline** - Repository ingestion and processing
- **⚡ Titan Training** - Distributed GPU training simulation  
- **🚀 Atlas Inference** - Code generation and inference
- **💻 Code Execution** - Containerized testing environment
- **📊 Evaluation** - Automated benchmarking framework

## 📁 Sample Data

10 popular repositories included:
React, Vue, Django, Flask, Express, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Kubernetes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, asyncio
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript with glassmorphism design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) integration ready
- **Deployment**: Containerized services

## 📊 Features
